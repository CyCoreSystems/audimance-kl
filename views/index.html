			Welcome to Audimance.
			This page holds the program, poetry and prose from disabled artists and scholars, and some background information about the performance.  At the beginning of the performance and after intermission, you will be automatically taken to the performance audio which you may navigate and mix to your liking by moving your finger around the screen.   
			Make sure that your wifi is on and that you are connected to the "" network, and note that during and around the performance you will also hear both speakers and the music soundtrack through the room audio rather than in your headphones, so you may wish to adjust your volume accordingly.
